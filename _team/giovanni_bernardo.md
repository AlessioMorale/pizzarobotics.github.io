Class 1977, born with a Commodore64, he started to learn programming on it during primary school using the Basic. That Commodore64 along with a lot of other vintage computers and gaming consoles fills for half his laboratory. With his wife founded an non-profit association about retro-technology ([associazione64](https://www.associazione64.it)) and organizes showcases and school tours showing evolution of technology.
  
He started programming Microchip PIC microcontrollers in the early 2000 and in 2007 built a blog where he shared (and continues nowadays) his experience about this world collaborating also with electronics-focused companies.
