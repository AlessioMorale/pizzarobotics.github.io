Software engineering and electronics are my hobbies since forever. Add to them an insane willingness to know how stuff works.


In 2010 I discovered by chance the world of multirotor and UAVs. Initially, they just were simple Arduino based projects, but soon moved to more advanced platforms. It is 2012 when I started collaborating with the OpenPilot project and later, in 2015, co-founded (with several of OpenPilot former developers), the [LibrePilot project](www.librepilot.org) as firmware and architecture lead.

Recently I'm interested in several other topics, including mobile robotics, ROS, products design and 3d printing.

Some of the projects I'm currently working on are Slammer, a rover robot and uNav2, an advanced motor control board for mobile robots
